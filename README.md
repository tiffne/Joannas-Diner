# Joanna's Diner

Joanna's Diner is a cooking and serving simulator game where you, Joanna the cow, own a diner in a town full of animals that would eat you if they find out your true identity. Disguise yourself, cook, and keep yourself calm as you attempt to earn enough money to buy a one way ticket out of this town. 

Made for the Vertical Slice DATT 2310 Lab 1 Game Jam.
